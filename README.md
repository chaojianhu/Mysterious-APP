# Mysterious-APP
A simple Android malware that eats up your internal storage.

Please refer to 'Reverse Engineering Techniques to Analyze Potential Malware for Android Devices.pdf' for why Mysterious APP was created.

The .zip file containing the actual .apk is encrypted (use password that I included with .txt to use if desired)

I've done this a while ago so it might not run in some of Android devices since Android .apk has sensitive issue with versions.
